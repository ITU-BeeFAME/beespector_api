# 1. Start with an official Python base image. 'slim' is a good choice for smaller size.
FROM python:3.11-slim

# 2. Set the working directory inside the container.
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy the requirements file first to leverage Docker's layer caching.

# 6. Expose the port that the application runs on inside the container.

# 7. The command to run your application when the container starts.
# --host 0.0.0.0 is essential to make it accessible from outside the container.
